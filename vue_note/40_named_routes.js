//  ðŸ‘‰named routes in Vue Router v4 with Vue.js 3.
//   Named routes allow you to give specific names to your routes, making it easier to reference and navigate between different routes in your application.Let's go through the steps and examples to understand how to use named routes.

// Step 1: Installation and Setup
// Before we begin, make sure you have Vue Router v4 installed in your Vue.js 3 project.If you haven't already, you can install it using npm or yarn:


// npm install vue - router@next
// Once installed, you'll need to set up Vue Router in your main application file, typically main.js:


// import { createApp } from 'vue';
// import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router';
// import App from './App.vue';

// const routes = [
//     // Your routes here
// ];

// const router = createRouter({
//     history: createWebHistory(),
//     routes,
// });

// const app = createApp(App);
// app.use(router);
// app.mount('#app');

// Step 2: Defining Named Routes
// In your routes array, you can define named routes by providing a name property to each route object.Here's an example:


// const routes = [
//     {
//         path: '/',
//         name: 'home',
//         component: Home,
//     },
//     {
//         path: '/about',
//         name: 'about',
//         component: About,
//     },
//     // Additional routes...
// ];

// In the above example, we have two routes: '/' with the name 'home' and '/about' with the name 'about'.

//     Step 3: Navigating using Named Routes
// Once you have named routes defined, you can use the router's push or replace methods to navigate to those routes. Here's how you can use named routes to navigate programmatically:


// Inside a Vue component or any other context where the `router` is available
// methods: {
//     navigateToHome() {
//         this.$router.push({ name: 'home' });
//     },
//     navigateToAbout() {
//         this.$router.push({ name: 'about' });
//     },
//     // Additional methods...
// }

// In the above example, we're using the push method of the $router object to navigate to the named routes 'home' and 'about'.

// Step 4: Generating Links with Named Routes
// You can also generate links to named routes using the router - link component.Here's an example of how you can create a link to the 'home' route:


//     < router - link : to = "{ name: 'home' }" > Home</router - link >
//         In the above example, the router - link component is bound to the name property of the route object, allowing you to generate a link to the 'home' route.

//             That's it! You have now learned how to use named routes in Vue Router v4 with Vue.js 3. You can define named routes, navigate using named routes, and generate links to named routes. Feel free to explore more features of Vue Router and experiment with different route configurations to build powerful and dynamic Vue.js applications.
