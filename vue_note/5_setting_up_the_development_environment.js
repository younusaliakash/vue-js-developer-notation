// âœ…Command for creating a project through vite :

// npm create vite @latest



// ðŸ‘‰To get started, we'll need to install some tools and configure our environment. Here's a step - by - step guide:

// âœ…Step 1: Install Node.js and npm
// Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows us to execute JavaScript outside of a browser.It also includes npm(Node Package Manager), which we'll use to install Vue.js and other dependencies.

// Visit the official Node.js website(https://nodejs.org) and download the latest stable version for your operating system.
//     Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Node.js.Make sure to include npm during the installation process.
// To verify that Node.js and npm are installed correctly, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:
    

// node--version
// npm--version


// These commands should display the version numbers of Node.js and npm, respectively.


//  âœ…   Step 2: Create a new Vue.js project
// Now that we have Node.js and npm installed, we can use Vue CLI(Command Line Interface) to create a new Vue.js project.

// Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Vue CLI globally:


// npm install - g @vue / cli

// Once the installation is complete, navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.For example, if you want to create a project in a folder called "my-vue-project," use the following command:


// cd path / to / my - vue - project

// Run the following command to create a new Vue.js project:

// vue create.

// The dot at the end of the command specifies the current directory as the project root.If you want to create the project in a subdirectory, replace the dot with the desired directory name.

// Vue CLI will prompt you to pick a preset for your project.For a basic setup, you can choose the default preset(Manually select features) by pressing Enter.

// Vue CLI will then present you with a list of features to choose from.You can use the arrow keys to navigate and the spacebar to select or deselect features.For a minimal setup, you can select Babel and Router, then press Enter.

// Vue CLI will ask whether you want to use history mode for the router.If you're unsure, you can choose the default option (Yes) by pressing Enter.

// Finally, Vue CLI will ask whether you want to save this as a preset for future projects.You can choose Yes or No based on your preference.

// âœ…    Step 3: Install project dependencies
// After creating the Vue.js project, we need to install the project dependencies defined in the package.json file.

// In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory(if you're not already in it).
// Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

// npm install

// âœ…Step 4: Start the development server
// Now that our project is set up, we can start the development server and see our Vue.js application in action.

// In the terminal or command prompt, make sure you're in the project directory.
// Run the following command to start the development server:

// npm run serve

// This command will start the development server and display the local development URL where you can access your Vue.js application(usually http://localhost:8080).




// ðŸ‘‰ Vite is a build tool that provides a fast and optimized development experience for Vue.js applications.Let's get started:

// Step 1: Install Node.js and npm
// Before we begin, ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.If you don't have them installed, please follow the instructions provided in Step 1 of the previous tutorial.

// Step 2: Create a new Vue.js 3 project with Vite
// To create a new Vue.js 3 project with Vite, follow these steps:

// Open a terminal or command prompt.

// Run the following command to install Vite globally:


// npm install - g create - vite
// Once the installation is complete, navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.For example, if you want to create a project in a folder called "my-vite-project," use the following command:


// cd path / to / my - vite - project
// Run the following command to create a new Vue.js project with Vite:


// create - vite.
// The dot at the end of the command specifies the current directory as the project root.If you want to create the project in a subdirectory, replace the dot with the desired directory name.

// Vite will prompt you to pick a framework for your project.Since you want to create a Vue.js project, press Enter to select the default option(vue).

// Vite will ask whether to use the JavaScript or TypeScript template.Choose your preferred option by pressing Enter.

// Vite will then install the project dependencies and set up the project structure for you.

//     Step 3: Start the development server
// After creating the project, we can start the development server and see our Vue.js application in action.

// In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory(if you're not already in it).

// Run the following command to install the project dependencies:


// npm install

// Once the installation is complete, start the development server by running the following command:


// npm run dev

// This command will start the Vite development server and display the local development URL where you can access your Vue.js application(usually http://localhost:3000).

//     Congratulations! You have successfully set up a Vue.js 3 project with Vite.You can now start building your Vue components, styles, and application logic in the project.
