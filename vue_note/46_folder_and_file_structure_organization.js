//ðŸ‘‰ Understand folder and file structure organization in Vue.js 3.
//  Organizing your project's codebase effectively can greatly improve maintainability and collaboration. In Vue.js, there isn't a strict folder structure enforced by the framework, but there are some common patterns that you can follow for a well - organized project.

//     Here's an example of a typical folder and file structure for a Vue.js 3 project:


// â”œâ”€â”€ src
// â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets
// â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components
// â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ views
// â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ router
// â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ store
// â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils
// â”‚   â””â”€â”€ App.vue
// â””â”€â”€ main.js
// Let's go through each folder and its purpose:

// src: This is the root folder where your Vue.js source code resides.

//     assets: This folder is used to store static assets like images, fonts, and stylesheets.

//         components: This folder contains reusable components used throughout your application.You can organize them further into subfolders based on their functionality or purpose.

//             Example:


// â”œâ”€â”€ components
// â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ common
// â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Button.vue
// â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Input.vue
// â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
// â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout
// â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Header.vue
// â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Sidebar.vue
// â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
// â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
// views: This folder contains your application's views or pages. Each view represents a distinct page or route in your application.

// Example:

// â”œâ”€â”€ views
// â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Home.vue
// â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ About.vue
// â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Profile.vue
// â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
// router: This folder is used to configure your application's routing. You can define routes and their associated components here.

// Example:

// â”œâ”€â”€ router
// â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
// â”‚   â””â”€â”€ routes.js
// store: This folder is used for state management using Vuex.You can define modules, actions, mutations, and getters related to your application's state management here.

// Example:


// â”œâ”€â”€ store
// â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
// â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ modules
// â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth.js
// â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cart.js
// â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
// â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
// utils: This folder contains utility functions, helpers, or mixins that can be used across your application.

//     Example:


// â”œâ”€â”€ utils
// â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api.js
// â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ date.js
// â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
// App.vue: This is the root component of your application.It serves as the entry point for your Vue.js application.

//     main.js: This is the main entry file where you create the Vue.js application instance and configure plugins.

// By organizing your project using this folder structure, you can keep your codebase clean, modular, and easier to navigate.Remember that this structure is just a suggestion, and you can adapt it based on your project's specific needs.

// I hope this explanation helps you understand the folder and file structure organization in Vue.js 3. Let me know if you have any further questions!
