// ðŸ‘‰Two - way data binding in Vue.js 3 with code examples.

// Two - way data binding allows you to automatically synchronize data between the model(JavaScript data) and the view(HTML template) in both directions.

// To demonstrate this concept, let's create a simple Vue.js 3 application that includes two-way data binding.

// First, make sure you have Vue.js 3 installed.You can use the following CDN link to include it in an HTML file:


//     < script src = "https://unpkg.com/vue@3.0.0/dist/vue.global.js" ></ >
//         Now, let's create an HTML file with the following code:


//     < div id = "app" >
//   <input v-model="message" type="text">
//   <p>{{ message }}</p>
// </>

// <script>
//   const app = Vue.createApp({
//     data() {
//       return {
//         message: ""
//       };
//     }
//   });

//   app.mount("#app");
// </script>
// In the code above, we have a simple Vue application with an input field and a paragraph element.The v - model directive is used on the input element to achieve two - way data binding.The message variable is bound to the input field, which means any changes made to the input value will automatically update the message variable.Similarly, any changes made to the message variable will update the input field.

// When you run this code, you'll see that the value you type into the input field is automatically displayed below it in the paragraph element. If you change the value in the paragraph element, the input field will also update accordingly.

// This is the basic concept of two - way data binding in Vue.js 3. The v - model directive simplifies the process of synchronizing data between the model and the view.

// You can extend this example further by adding more elements and binding them to the data properties.Two - way data binding is not limited to just input fields; it can be used with various other form elements like checkboxes, radio buttons, and select dropdowns.

// I hope this explanation and example helped you understand how to implement two - way data binding in Vue.js 3.
