// ðŸ‘‰Vue CLI in Vue.js 3. 
// Vue CLI is a command - line tool that helps you scaffold and manage Vue.js projects.It provides a simple and efficient way to set up a Vue.js development environment with all the necessary build tools and configurations.

// To get started, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine, as Vue CLI requires it to run.Once you have Node.js installed, you can install Vue CLI globally using the following command:


// npm install - g @vue/cli
// Once the installation is complete, you can create a new Vue.js project using the Vue CLI.Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the desired directory, and run the following command:


// vue create my - project
// Replace my - project with the name you want to give your project.Vue CLI will ask you to choose a preset for your project.You can select the default preset by pressing Enter, or you can manually select features like Babel, ESLint, and Unit Testing based on your project requirements.

// After selecting the preset, Vue CLI will install the necessary dependencies and scaffold the project structure for you.Once the process is complete, navigate to your project's directory:

// cd my - project
// Now, let's run your Vue.js application locally. Use the following command:


// npm run serve
// This will start a local development server, and you can access your application in the browser at http://localhost:8080 (unless you've changed the default configuration).

// With your Vue.js project up and running, you can start writing components and building your application.Let's create a simple example component called HelloWorld. In your project, navigate to the src directory and create a new file called HelloWorld.vue. Add the following code to that file:


//     < template >
//     <div>
//         <h1>{{ greeting }}</h1>
//     </div>
// </ >

//     <script>
//         export default {
//             data() {
//     return {
//             greeting: 'Hello, Vue CLI!',
//     };
//   },
// };
//     </script>
// Now, in the App.vue component, update the template to use the HelloWorld component.Replace the existing content with the following code:


//     < template >
//     <div id="app">
//         <HelloWorld />
//     </div>
// </ >

//     <script>
//         import HelloWorld from './HelloWorld.vue';

//         export default {
//             components: {
//             HelloWorld,
//   },
// };
//     </script>
// Now, if you switch back to your browser, you should see the greeting "Hello, Vue CLI!" rendered on the screen.

//     That's a basic example to get you started with Vue CLI in Vue.js 3. From here, you can continue exploring Vue CLI's capabilities and building more complex applications.

// I hope this helps you get started with Vue CLI in Vue.js 3! If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.



// Creating a Vue project with a specific template:
// Vue CLI allows you to create a project using different templates.For example, you can create a project with a TypeScript template using the following command:


// vue create my - project--preset = @vue / cli - preset - typescript
// This will scaffold a new Vue project with TypeScript support.

// Plugins and Vue CLI UI:
// Vue CLI provides a plugin system that allows you to extend your project's functionality with additional features. You can add plugins during the project creation process or add them later using the vue add command. For example, to add the Vuex store to your project, you can run:


// vue add vuex
// Additionally, Vue CLI offers a graphical user interface called Vue UI.You can access it by running vue ui in your terminal, which opens a browser - based GUI to manage your Vue projects.

// Building and deploying your Vue app:
// When you're ready to deploy your Vue app to a production environment, you'll need to build it first.Use the following command to create an optimized production build:


// npm run build
// This command compiles and minifies your code, creating a dist directory with the bundled files ready for deployment.You can then upload the contents of the dist directory to a static file server or a hosting service of your choice.

// Environment variables:
// Vue CLI allows you to define environment variables that can be accessed in your application's code. Environment variables are useful for managing different configurations for development, staging, and production environments. To define environment variables, create files with a .env prefix (e.g., .env, .env.development, .env.production) in the root of your project. Any variables defined in these files will be accessible in your app through process.env.

// Customizing configuration:
// Vue CLI provides a way to customize your project's configuration using a vue.config.js file in the project root. This file allows you to modify various aspects of the build process, configure webpack, set up proxy servers, and more. Refer to the Vue CLI documentation for detailed information on the available configuration options.

// These are just a few additional aspects of working with Vue CLI in Vue.js 3. Vue CLI offers many more features, such as testing setup, linting, and code formatting configurations, which can greatly enhance your development workflow.Feel free to explore the official Vue CLI documentation for more in -depth information and examples.




// Customizing Babel configuration:
// Vue CLI uses Babel for transpiling your code, and you can customize its configuration.To do so, create a babel.config.js file in the root of your project.This file allows you to specify Babel presets, plugins, and other configuration options.For example, if you want to use a specific Babel plugin, you can install it via npm and include it in your Babel configuration.

// Managing dependencies and plugins:
// Vue CLI provides a project dependency management system called Vue CLI Service.It handles the management and installation of project - specific dependencies, including both runtime and development dependencies.You can manage your dependencies by modifying the package.json file or by using the npm or yarn commands directly.

// Running tests:
// Vue CLI supports testing your Vue.js components using popular testing frameworks like Jest, Mocha, and Cypress.You can configure and run tests by adding the appropriate dependencies and configuring the test scripts in the package.json file.Refer to the documentation of your chosen testing framework for more details on how to write and run tests in Vue.js.

// Customizing the development server:
// During development, Vue CLI provides a built -in development server that supports hot - reloading and other helpful features.You can customize the behavior of the development server by adding a vue.config.js file and specifying the devServer configuration options.For example, you can set up proxying for API requests, configure SSL, or adjust the port and host settings.

// Building for production with different modes:
// Vue CLI allows you to build your application for different deployment environments by using different modes.By default, Vue CLI supports development and production modes.You can create additional modes to target different environments such as staging or testing.Each mode can have its own configuration options and environment variables, allowing you to fine - tune your builds for specific scenarios.

// These are some advanced concepts and features related to Vue CLI in Vue.js 3. They provide additional flexibility and customization options for your Vue.js projects.As always, I encourage you to refer to the official Vue CLI documentation for more detailed information and examples.
