// ðŸ‘‰ref and reactive objects in Vue.js 3.

// In Vue.js 3, the Composition API introduces the ref function and the concept of reactive objects.They allow you to create and manage reactive data in your components.Let's explore each concept and provide some code examples to illustrate their usage.

// âœ…ref:
// The ref function is used to create a reactive reference to a value.It wraps the value and returns a reactive object.The reactive object can be accessed and modified like a regular JavaScript variable, but it will trigger reactivity when the value changes.
//     Here's an example:


// import { ref } from 'vue';

// const count = ref(0);

// console.log(count.value); // Output: 0

// count.value++; // Update the value

// console.log(count.value); // Output: 1

// In the example above, we import the ref function from the Vue package.We create a reactive reference called count with an initial value of 0 using ref(0).We access the value of count using count.value.We can modify the value of count like a regular variable, and the reactivity system will automatically update any components that depend on it.

// âœ…Reactive objects:
// Reactive objects allow you to create a reactive version of an entire object.You can use the reactive function to create a reactive object, which wraps the original object and enables reactivity on its properties.
//     Here's an example:


// import { reactive } from 'vue';

// const person = reactive({
//     name: 'John Doe',
//     age: 30,
// });

// console.log(person.name); // Output: 'John Doe'

// person.age++; // Update the age property

// console.log(person.age); // Output: 31

// In this example, we import the reactive function from the Vue package.We create a reactive object called person using reactive({ ... }).The object has two properties: name and age.We can access and modify the properties of person like regular JavaScript properties.The reactivity system will automatically detect changes and update any components that rely on these properties.

// These are the basic concepts of ref and reactive objects in Vue.js 3. By using ref and creating reactive objects, you can manage reactive data in your Vue components.Remember to always access the value of a ref using.value, and use reactive to create reactive versions of entire objects.

// I hope this explanation helps you understand ref and reactive objects in Vue.js 3.
