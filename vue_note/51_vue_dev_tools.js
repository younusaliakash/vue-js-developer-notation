// ðŸ‘‰Vue DevTools with Vue.js 3. 
// Vue DevTools is a browser extension that allows you to inspect and debug Vue applications.It provides useful features for debugging and understanding how your Vue components are working.

// To get started, follow these steps:

// Step 1: Install Vue DevTools Extension
// First, make sure you have a modern web browser installed, such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.Then, visit the respective extension store for your browser and search for "Vue DevTools." Install the extension, and it will be added to your browser.

//     Step 2: Create a Vue.js 3 Project
// If you don't have a Vue.js 3 project yet, you can create a new one using the Vue CLI (Command Line Interface). Open your terminal and run the following commands:

// # Install Vue CLI globally(if you haven't installed it before)
// npm install - g @vue/cli

// # Create a new Vue project
// vue create vue - devtools - demo
// The above commands will create a new Vue project in a directory called "vue-devtools-demo."

// Step 3: Open Your Vue Project in the Browser
// Navigate to your project folder using the terminal:


// cd vue - devtools - demo
// Then, start the development server:


// npm run serve
// This command will start the development server, and you will see a URL(usually http://localhost:8080/) where your Vue project is running. Open this URL in your browser.

//     Step 4: Enable Vue DevTools
// In your browser, click on the Vue DevTools extension icon(usually located in the browser toolbar).It should open a panel with the Vue logo.

//     Step 5: Inspect Components and State
// Now that you have Vue DevTools enabled, you can start inspecting your Vue components and their state.

// For example, let's say you have a component named Counter that increments a counter value:

//     < template >
//     <div>
//         <p>Count: {{ count }}</p>
//         <button @click="increment">Increment</button>
//   </div >
// </ >

//     <script>
//         export default {
//             data() {
//     return {
//             count: 0
//     };
//   },
//         methods: {
//             increment() {
//             this.count++;
//     }
//   }
// };
//     </script>
// If you have this component in your project, you can use Vue DevTools to inspect it:

// In the Vue DevTools panel, click on the "Components" tab.
// Look for your component(<Counter>) in the tree view. You should see the component's name and its current state (count: 0).
//         Click on the component to expand it and see the component's properties, methods, and other details.
//         You can also modify the component's state directly from the Vue DevTools panel. For example, you can change the count value to 10 and see the component update accordingly.
//         Step 6: Debug Vue Components
//         Vue DevTools provides powerful debugging capabilities. You can set breakpoints, inspect component lifecycles, and monitor events.

//         To debug your Vue components using Vue DevTools:

//         Open your browser's developer tools (usually by right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect" or using the F12 key).
//         Navigate to the "Vue" or "Components" tab in the developer tools.
//         Find your component and click on it to inspect its properties and state.
//         In the "Events" tab, you can see all the events emitted by the component and their payloads.
//         You can set breakpoints in your component's code


//         Step 6: Debug Vue Components (continued)
//         To set breakpoints and debug your Vue components:

//         In the "Components" tab of Vue DevTools, locate your component of interest.
//         Expand the component to view its properties, data, computed properties, and methods.
//         To set a breakpoint, click on the line number next to the code where you want the execution to pause. This will add a red dot indicating the breakpoint.
//         Trigger the code execution by interacting with your application (e.g., clicking a button that triggers a method).
//         Once the breakpoint is hit, the execution will pause, and you can inspect the component's state, variables, and the call stack in the browser's developer tools.
//         You can step through the code using the debugger controls (e.g., Step Into, Step Over, Step Out) to understand how the component's logic is executed.
//         Use the Console panel in the browser's developer tools to execute JavaScript code and log values.
//         Step 7: Performance Monitoring
//         Vue DevTools also provides performance monitoring features to help optimize your Vue.js applications.

//         Open the "Performance" tab in Vue DevTools.
//         Click on the "Start Recording" button to begin profiling your application.
//         Interact with your application, perform actions, and navigate to different routes or components that you want to analyze.
//         Click on the "Stop Recording" button to end the profiling session.
//         Vue DevTools will display a timeline of events, showing how long each component took to render and update.
//         You can identify performance bottlenecks by analyzing the timeline and finding components that take a significant amount of time to render.
//         Optimize your application by optimizing the performance of those components.
//         Step 8: Other Features
//         Vue DevTools offers additional features that can aid in debugging and development:

//         Vuex Inspector: If you are using Vuex for state management in your Vue.js application, Vue DevTools provides a dedicated "Vuex" tab to inspect the Vuex store, mutations, actions, and state changes.
//         Vue Router Integration: If your application uses Vue Router for routing, Vue DevTools integrates with it and provides a "Router" tab to inspect and control the router's behavior.
//         Time Travel Debugging: Vue DevTools allows you to travel back in time and inspect previous states and actions, helping you debug issues that occurred in the past.
//         Remember to refer to the official Vue DevTools documentation for more detailed information on all the features and capabilities it offers: https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools
