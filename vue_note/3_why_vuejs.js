// ðŸ‘‰Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework that is widely used for building user interfaces.Version 3 of Vue.js comes with several improvements and new features that make it a powerful tool for developing web applications.Let's dive into the details!

// âœ…Composition API:
// One of the major enhancements in Vue.js 3 is the introduction of the Composition API.This API provides a more flexible and scalable way to organize and reuse code in your Vue components.It allows you to encapsulate related logic into reusable functions called "composition functions" and then use them in your components.This promotes better code organization, reusability, and maintainability.Here's an example:

//     < template >
//     <div>
//         <p>Count: {{ count }}</p>
//         <button @click="increment">Increment</button>
//   </div >
// </ >

//     <script>
//         import {ref} from 'vue';

//         export default {
//             setup() {
//     const count = ref(0);
    
//     const increment = () => {
//             count.value++;
//     };

//         return {
//             count,
//             increment
//         };
//   }
// };
//     </script>

// In this example, we're using the ref function from the Composition API to create a reactive variable called count. The setup function is where we define our composition logic, including the increment function. We then return the variables and functions we want to expose to the template.

//âœ… Better TypeScript Support:

// Vue.js 3 has improved support for TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript.TypeScript helps catch potential errors and provides better tooling for code editors.With Vue.js 3, you can now take full advantage of TypeScript's type checking capabilities. Vue components can be defined with explicit type annotations, making it easier to catch errors and enforce proper prop and event handling.

// âœ…Smaller Bundle Size:
// Vue.js 3 comes with a smaller bundle size compared to its predecessor, Vue.js 2. This is achieved by leveraging the new compiler architecture, which allows for more efficient code generation.The smaller bundle size leads to faster loading times for your web applications, resulting in a better user experience.

//âœ… Improved Reactivity System:
// The reactivity system in Vue.js 3 has been rewritten to provide better performance and more features.The new system is based on a proxy - based approach, which enables Vue to track dependencies more accurately.This means that when the underlying data changes, only the affected components will be updated, resulting in better performance.

// These are just a few of the notable improvements in Vue.js 3. It's important to note that while Vue.js 3 introduces these new features, it still maintains a similar API and developer experience to Vue.js 2, making the transition for existing Vue.js developers relatively smooth.
