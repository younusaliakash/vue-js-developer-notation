// ðŸ‘‰Understand component slots and scoped slots in Vue.js 3. Slots are a powerful feature in Vue.js that allow you to compose components and pass content from the parent component to its children. Scoped slots, in particular, give you more control over how the content is rendered in the child component.

// âœ…Let's start by understanding component slots. Imagine you have a parent component that needs to render some dynamic content inside it. You can define a slot in the parent component and provide the content from the parent. Here's an example:


// <!-- ParentComponent.vue -->
{/* <template>
  <div>
    <h1>Parent Component</h1>
    <slot></slot>
  </div>
</template>

In this example, the <slot></slot> element serves as a placeholder where the content will be injected. Now, in the parent component, you can use the <parent-component> tag and place any content inside it. For instance:


<!-- App.vue -->
<template>
  <div>
    <parent-component>
      <p>Content passed from parent</p>
    </parent-component>
  </div>
</template> */}

// When this code is rendered, the content <p>Content passed from parent</p> will replace the <slot></slot> element in the ParentComponent.vue template.

// âœ…Now, let's move on to scoped slots. Scoped slots allow you to pass data from the child component back to the parent component. This is useful when you want to customize how the content is rendered in the parent component based on some data from the child component. Here's an example:


// <!-- ChildComponent.vue -->
{/* <template>
  <div>
    <h2>Child Component</h2>
    <slot :data="message"></slot>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      message: 'Hello from child component!'
    };
  }
};
</script> */}

// In this example, we define a slot with a data attribute bound to the message property of the child component. Now, in the parent component, we can access this data using the v-slot directive and customize how it's rendered. Here's an example:


// <!-- App.vue -->
{/* <template>
  <div>
    <parent-component>
      <template v-slot:default="slotProps">
        <p>{{ slotProps.data }}</p>
      </template>
    </parent-component>
  </div>
    </template> */}

// In this code, we use the v-slot:default directive to access the data passed from the child component. We assign it to a variable called slotProps which gives us access to the data inside the template. We can then use slotProps.data to render the content.

// âœ…Scoped slots can also have named slots, allowing you to have multiple slots in a child component with different data being passed to each. To define a named slot, you can use the v-slot:name syntax. Here's an example:


// <!-- ChildComponent.vue -->
{/* <template>
  <div>
    <h2>Child Component</h2>
    <slot name="customSlot" :data="customMessage"></slot>
  </div>
</template> */}

{/* <script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      customMessage: 'Hello from custom slot!'
    };
  }
};
</script> */}
// And in the parent component:

// <!-- App.vue -->
// <template>
//   <div>
//     <parent-component> 
//         <template v-slot:customSlot="slotProps">
//           <p>{{ slotProps.data }}</p>
//         </template>
//       </parent-component>
//     </div>
//     </template>
  
// In this example, we define a named slot called "customSlot" in the child component. It passes the customMessage data to the parent component. In the parent component, we use v-slot:customSlot to access this specific named slot and render its content.

// Scoped slots are powerful because they allow you to pass data from child components to parent components and give you flexibility in how the content is rendered. They can be especially useful when you need to customize the rendering logic based on dynamic data in your application.

// It's important to note that in Vue.js 3, the syntax for scoped slots has changed from Vue.js 2. If you are using Vue.js 2, the syntax would be slightly different. However, since you specifically asked about Vue.js 3, I have provided examples using the Vue.js 3 syntax.
