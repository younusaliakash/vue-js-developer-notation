// ðŸ‘‰Vue Application

// import { createApp } from 'vue'
// import plugin from './pugin'
// const app = createApp({
//     /* root component options */
// });
// app.use(plugin);
// app.mount('#app')



//âœ… Explanation:

// Let's break down the code step by step:

// import { createApp } from 'vue': This line imports the createApp function from the 'vue' module.This function is used to create a new Vue application.

// import plugin from './plugin': This line imports a plugin from a file called 'plugin.js' located in the same directory as the current file.The plugin is assigned to the variable plugin.

// const app = createApp({ /* root component options */ }): This line creates a new Vue application by invoking the createApp function. The function takes an object as an argument, which represents the options for the root component of the application.In this code snippet, the object is empty, but you can add various configuration options such as data, methods, computed properties, and lifecycle hooks to customize the root component.

//     app.use(plugin): This line registers the imported plugin with the Vue application.The use method is a Vue plugin installation method that allows you to extend the functionality of the application with additional features provided by the plugin.

//         app.mount('#app'): This line mounts the Vue application to an HTML element with the ID "app".The application will be rendered inside this element, effectively replacing its contents with the Vue components and template.

//             Overall, this code sets up a Vue application, configures the root component, adds a plugin to extend the application's functionality, and mounts the application to an HTML element with the ID "app".
