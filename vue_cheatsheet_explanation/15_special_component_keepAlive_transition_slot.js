// ✅ Explanation :

//  Let's go through it step by step:


//     < template >
//   < !--KeepAlive, caches dynamically toggled components wrapped inside, often used for Tabs-- >
//     <KeepAlive>
//         <component: is="view"></component:>
//   </KeepAlive >

//   < !--Transition, provides animated transition effects to a single element or component-- >
//     <Transition name="fade" mode="out-in" appear>
//         <component: is="view"></component:>
//   </Transition >

//   < !--TransitionGroup, provides transition effects for multiple elements or components in a list-- >
//     <TransitionGroup tag="ul" name="slide">
//         <li v-for="item in items" :key="item.id">
//         {{ item.text }}
//     </li>
//   </TransitionGroup >

//   < !--Slot, denotes slot content outlets in templates-- >
//   <FancyButton>
//     Click me! <!-- slot content -->
//   </FancyButton>

//   <!--The < slot > element is a slot outlet that indicates where the parent - provided slot content-- >
//     <button class="fancy-btn">
//         <slot></slot> <!-- slot outlet -->
//     </button>
// </template >
//     This code snippet is written in Vue.js 3 and contains various Vue components and directives.Let's break it down:

//         < KeepAlive >: This is a built -in Vue component that wraps the dynamically toggled components inside it.It helps to cache the components so that their state is preserved when they are toggled.It is commonly used for implementing tabs, where switching between tabs keeps the state of each tab intact.

// < Transition >: This is another built -in Vue component used for adding animated transition effects to a single element or component.In this case, it has a name attribute set to "fade" which corresponds to a CSS transition defined elsewhere.The mode attribute is set to "out-in" which means the old component will transition out first, followed by the new component transitioning in.The appear attribute allows the transition to occur when the component is initially rendered.

// < TransitionGroup >: This is a built -in Vue component used for applying transition effects to multiple elements or components within a list.It has a tag attribute set to "ul" indicating that the elements inside it will be rendered as an unordered list.The name attribute is set to "slide" which corresponds to a CSS transition defined elsewhere.Inside < TransitionGroup >, we have a < li > element rendered for each item in the items array.The :key attribute is used to uniquely identify each item.

// < FancyButton >: This is a custom component named "FancyButton" that is being used as a wrapper.It can receive content inside it using the < slot ></ > syntax.In this case, the content is "Click me!".

// < slot >: This is a slot outlet inside the custom < button > component.It indicates the position where the content from the parent component will be inserted.The content will be replaced with the content provided when using the < FancyButton > component.

//     That's a brief explanation of the code snippet you provided. Each of these Vue components and directives serves a specific purpose in Vue.js applications and allows for modular and reusable code.
