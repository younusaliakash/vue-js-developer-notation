// âœ… Explanation :


// In the given code snippet, we have a Vue.js 3 script section where we are registering components.

// In Vue.js, components need to be registered before they can be used within a template.Registration allows Vue to recognize and render the components correctly.Let's break down the code and understand it step by step:


//     < script >
     //imported components needs to be "registered", use PascalCase
//     names
// components: {
//     MyComp, // shorthand
//         RenamedMyComp: MyComp // register under a different name
// },
// </ >
//     The components property is used to register components in Vue.js.It is an object where each key - value pair represents the component's name and its corresponding component definition.

// The component names are typically written in PascalCase(camel case with the first letter capitalized). It's a convention in Vue.js to differentiate components from regular HTML elements or attributes.

// In the code snippet, there are two components being registered: MyComp and RenamedMyComp.

// The line MyComp is using shorthand notation.This means that both the key and the value are the same, so the component will be registered with the name MyComp.

// The line RenamedMyComp: MyComp registers the component with a different name.It assigns the component MyComp to a new name RenamedMyComp.This allows you to use the component in your template using the new name RenamedMyComp.

// By registering components in this way, you can use them within the template section of your Vue component.For example, if you have a template like < RenamedMyComp ></ >, it will render the component MyComp under the name RenamedMyComp.

//     Remember, in order to use this code, you would need to have the necessary imports for MyComp and make sure the components are properly defined before the components property in the Vue component.
