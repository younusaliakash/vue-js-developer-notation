// Question 1:
// What are the caveats with Vuex mutations ?
//     ✅Explanation
// There are a few caveats to keep in mind when working with Vuex mutations.One important caveat is that mutations should be synchronous.This is because Vuex relies on synchronous mutations to track and log state changes, allowing for time - travel debugging and predictable state management.Asynchronous operations or side effects should be handled in actions, which in turn can commit mutations.Another caveat is to avoid direct state mutations outside of mutations.Vuex enforces a strict rule that mutations are the only way to modify the state to ensure a clear and traceable data flow.Directly modifying the state outside of mutations can lead to unexpected behavior and make it harder to track state changes.By following these guidelines and best practices, you can leverage the full power and benefits of Vuex mutations.For more information on the caveats with Vuex mutations, you can refer to the Vuex documentation: https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/mutations.html#caveats.

// Question 2:
// Why should mutations be synchronous in Vuex ?
//     ✅Explanation
// Mutations in Vuex should be synchronous to ensure predictable state management and enable time - travel debugging.Vuex uses synchronous mutations to track and log state changes, allowing you to travel back and forth in time and inspect the state at different points.Synchronous mutations also simplify the debugging process and make it easier to reason about the application's data flow. Asynchronous operations or side effects should be handled in actions, which can then commit synchronous mutations. By adhering to the synchronous nature of mutations, you can maintain a clear and traceable data flow in your Vuex store. For more information on why mutations should be synchronous in Vuex, you can refer to the Vuex documentation: https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/mutations.html#mutations-follow-vue-s-reactivity-rules.

// Question 3:
// How do you perform mutations in components ?
//     ✅Explanation
// Mutations in components can be performed by committing them using the commit method provided by the Vuex store.To invoke a mutation, you need to call this.$store.commit('mutationName') in the component, where 'mutationName' is the name of the mutation defined in the Vuex store.This triggers the associated mutation handler, and the state is modified accordingly.If the mutation requires a payload, you can pass it as the second argument to the commit method: this.$store.commit('mutationName', payload).By committing mutations in components, you ensure that the state changes are tracked and logged by Vuex, providing a clear data flow and enabling time - travel debugging.For more information on performing mutations in components, you can refer to the Vuex documentation: https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/mutations.html#committing-mutations.

// Question 4:
// Is it mandatory to use constants for mutation types in Vuex ?
//     ✅Explanation
// Using constants for mutation types in Vuex is not mandatory, but it is a recommended practice.Constants provide a clear and centralized way to define and reference mutation types in your Vuex store.By using constants, you can avoid hard - coded strings and reduce the chance of typos or naming conflicts.Constants also make it easier to maintain and refactor your code.However, if you prefer, you can use strings directly as mutation types in Vuex without using constants.It is a matter of personal preference and project requirements.For more information on using constants for mutation types in Vuex, you can refer to the Vuex documentation: https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/mutations.html#using-constants-for-mutation-types.

// Question 5:
// How do you perform asynchronous operations in Vuex ?
//     ✅Explanation
// Asynchronous operations in Vuex can be performed by using actions.Actions in Vuex are similar to mutations, but they are designed for handling asynchronous operations.Actions are defined in the Vuex store using the actions property, and they can contain any asynchronous logic, such as making API calls, performing asynchronous computations, or dispatching multiple mutations.Actions can be invoked from components using the dispatch method provided by the Vuex store: this.$store.dispatch('actionName').Actions can also receive a payload if needed: this.$store.dispatch('actionName', payload).Inside actions, you can perform asynchronous operations and then commit mutations using the commit method to modify the state.For more information on performing asynchronous operations in Vuex, you can refer to the Vuex documentation: https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/actions.html.

// Question 6:
// What are the differences between mutations and actions in Vuex ?
//     ✅Explanation
// Mutations and actions have distinct roles in Vuex.Mutations are responsible for modifying the state in a synchronous manner.They should be used to update the state directly and ensure that state changes are logged and tracked by Vuex.Actions, on the other hand, are used to handle asynchronous operations, such as making API requests or performing time - consuming computations.Actions can contain asynchronous logic and can dispatch mutations to modify the state.Actions provide a way to encapsulate complex or asynchronous operations and coordinate multiple mutations.By separating mutations and actions, you can maintain a clear and predictable data flow in your Vuex store.For more information on the differences between mutations and actions in Vuex, you can refer to the Vuex documentation: https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/actions.html.

// Question 7:
// What is the purpose of the < keep - alive > tag in Vue.js ?
//     ✅Explanation
// The purpose of the < keep - alive > tag in Vue.js is to cache and preserve the state of components to improve performance.When a component is wrapped with the < keep - alive > tag, Vue.js will cache the instance of that component instead of destroying and recreating it when it is toggled on and off.This allows the component to retain its internal state, avoid unnecessary re - rendering, and provide a smoother user experience.The < keep - alive > tag is useful for components that are frequently toggled or reused, such as tabs, modals, or lists.By keeping the component alive in the cache, Vue.js can efficiently render it when needed, reducing the overhead of component initialization and improving overall performance.For more information on the < keep - alive > tag in Vue.js, you can refer to the Vue.js documentation: https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#keep-alive.

// Question 8:
// What are async components in Vue.js ?
//     ✅Explanation
// Async components in Vue.js refer to the ability to asynchronously load and render components.It allows you to split your application into smaller chunks and load components on - demand, improving initial page load time and overall performance.By using the import() function or dynamic import syntax, you can asynchronously import and register components, and Vue.js will load and render them when needed.Async components are typically used in scenarios where certain components are not immediately required or when the component's content depends on external factors, such as user interactions or data availability. For more information on async components in Vue.js, you can refer to the Vue.js documentation: https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-dynamic-async.html#Async-Components.

// Question 9:
// How do you dispatch actions in Vue.js ?
//     ✅Explanation
// In Vue.js, actions can be dispatched using the dispatch method from the Vuex store.Vuex is a state management pattern and library for Vue.js applications.Actions are functions defined in the Vuex store that perform asynchronous operations or complex logic.By calling the dispatch method with the name of the action, you can trigger the corresponding action in the store.Actions are typically used to handle asynchronous tasks, such as making API requests, before committing mutations to update the state.Dispatching actions helps separate the concerns of handling async operations and updating the state, leading to more maintainable and testable code.For more information on dispatching actions in Vue.js, you can refer to the Vuex documentation: https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/actions.html.

// Question 10:
// Can you dispatch an action using a payload or an object in Vue.js ?
//     ✅Explanation
// Yes, you can dispatch an action in Vue.js using either a payload or an object.When dispatching an action, you can provide a payload as the second argument to the dispatch method.The payload can be any value, such as a string, number, or an object containing multiple values.Additionally, instead of providing a payload directly, you can pass an object to the dispatch method.This object can include multiple properties or values that will be accessible within the action.Using an object can provide more flexibility and clarity in passing multiple values or parameters to the action.For more details on dispatching actions with payloads or objects in Vue.js, you can refer to the Vuex documentation: https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/actions.html#dispatching-actions.

// Question 11:
// Can I use styled components in Vue.js ?
//     ✅Explanation
// While styled components are primarily associated with React.js and the Styled Components library, in Vue.js, you can achieve similar functionality using CSS frameworks and techniques specific to Vue.js.Vue provides built -in support for scoped CSS, allowing you to encapsulate styles within a component and prevent them from affecting other components.This can be achieved by using the < style > block in a single - file component or by using CSS preprocessors with Vue Loader.CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less can be used in combination with Vue Loader to write modular and reusable styles.Additionally, there are Vue - specific CSS frameworks and libraries available, such as Vuetify and Element UI, that provide a wide range of pre - styled components to use in your Vue.js applications.While they may not be directly equivalent to styled components in terms of syntax and functionality, they offer similar benefits of reusable and customizable components.For more information on styling components in Vue.js, you can refer to the Vue.js documentation and the documentation of the specific CSS framework or library you choose to use.

//     Question 12:
// How do you dispatch actions in components in Vue.js ?
//     ✅Explanation
// In Vue.js components, actions can be dispatched using the $store.dispatch method provided by Vuex.This method allows you to trigger an action defined in the Vuex store.By calling $store.dispatch with the name of the action as the first argument, you can initiate the corresponding action.This is typically done within methods or event handlers of the component.The dispatched action will then execute any asynchronous operations or complex logic defined in the action before committing mutations to update the state.The $store object is automatically injected into the Vue.js component, providing access to the Vuex store and its dispatch method.For more information on dispatching actions in components in Vue.js, you can refer to the Vuex documentation: https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/actions.html#dispatching-actions.

// Question 13:
// How do you compose actions in Vuex ?
//     ✅Explanation
// In Vuex, actions can be composed by chaining multiple actions together using the async / await syntax.You can define a new action that calls other actions using the await keyword, allowing you to wait for the completion of one action before calling the next one.This approach helps in structuring complex workflows or performing a series of asynchronous operations in a modular manner.By composing actions, you can promote reusability and maintainability by breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable actions.Composed actions can be defined within the Vuex store's actions property or within individual action functions. For more information on composing actions in Vuex, you can refer to the Vuex documentation: https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/actions.html#composing-actions.

// Question 14:
// What are modules in Vuex ?
//     ✅Explanation
// In Vuex, modules are used to organize the store's state, mutations, actions, and getters into separate namespaces. Modules provide a way to break down the Vuex store into smaller, manageable units, making it easier to scale and maintain large applications. Each module can have its own state, mutations, actions, and getters, encapsulating related functionality and data. Modules can also be nested to create a hierarchical structure, allowing for even more granular control over the store. By separating concerns into modules, you can improve code organization, reusability, and maintainability in complex Vuex applications. For more information on using modules in Vuex, you can refer to the Vuex documentation: https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/modules.html.

// Question 15:
// What is module local state in Vuex ?
//     ✅Explanation
// In Vuex, module local state refers to the state that is specific to a particular module.Each module in Vuex can have its own state object, which is independent of the root state.This allows modules to have their own isolated state and makes it easier to manage and organize the state for different parts of the application.Module local state is accessed using the state property within a module definition.By using module local state, you can encapsulate and modularize the state management within the Vuex store.For more information on module local state in Vuex, you can refer to the Vuex documentation: https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/modules.html#module-local-state.

// Question 16:
// What is namespacing in Vuex ?
//     ✅Explanation
// In Vuex, namespacing is a feature that allows you to create a separate namespace for each module.By enabling namespacing, each module 's state, mutations, actions, and getters are encapsulated within its own namespace, preventing naming conflicts with other modules. This provides a clear separation of module names and makes it easier to manage and reference module-specific elements within the Vuex store. Namespacing also helps in organizing and structuring large Vuex applications by providing a hierarchical structure of modules. For more information on namespacing in Vuex, you can refer to the Vuex documentation: https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/modules.html#namespacing.

// Question 17:
// How do you dispatch actions in components in Vue.js ?
//     ✅Explanation
// In Vue.js components, actions can be dispatched using the $store.dispatch method provided by Vuex or by importing the action function from the store and directly calling it.The $store.dispatch method allows you to trigger an action defined in the Vuex store by passing the action's name as the first argument. This is typically done within methods or event handlers of the component. If you prefer, you can also import the action function directly from the store and call it as a regular function. Both methods will initiate the corresponding action, which can perform asynchronous operations or complex logic before committing mutations to update the state. For more information on dispatching actions in components in Vue.js, you can refer to the Vuex documentation: https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/actions.html#dispatching-actions.

// Question 18:
// How do you compose actions in Vuex ?
